# ✨ Daily Faith

Created by Natasha Tran

[Live Site 🌿](https://dailyfaith.netlify.app/)

**Daily Faith** is a calming web app designed to help users build a daily spiritual practice through reflection, prayer, and journaling. Inspired by my own journey exploring Catholicism, this app creates a digital space for peaceful, consistent faith-based reflection.
